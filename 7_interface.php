<!-- It supports the concept of hierarchical classification.

Inheritance has three types, 

    -Single Inheritance         (B->A)
    -Multilevel Inheritance     (A->B->C)
    -Hierarchical Inheritance   (B->A, C->A)
    -Multiple Inheritance       (Not Possible in PHP but simulate multiple inheritance by using "interfaces" )

PHP supports only single inheritance, where only one class can be derived from single parent class.

We can simulate multiple inheritance by using interfaces. -->
